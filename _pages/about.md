I am working as a Quantum Machine Learning Research Intern at IBM India, which includes research on error mitigation techniques using machine learning that can be incorporated with the Qiskit transpiler. I am also an Undergraduate in Electronics & Communications Engineering at RVCE, Bangalore and an MITx MicroMasters student in Data Science & Statistics.
