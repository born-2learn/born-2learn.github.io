## Aim of the Project

details

## Literature Survey

details

## Why have we used entropy as to quantify entanglement?

details

## Entanglement Metrics Used

### von_Neumann Entropy measure
details

### Meyer Wallach Entropy measure

details

## Toy Model under study

bell state model

## Variational Quantum Classifier Setup

### Specifications
- ZZFeatureMap
- RealAmplitudes
- ADAM optimizer
- sigmoid estimation cost function
  
### Datsets used
- ad hoc dataset from ibm ml datasets
- synthetic data generated from sklearn's make_blobs with varying std_deviations

## Results

- plots obtained for the following
	- vN vs epochs, vN vs loss function
	- mW vs epochs, mW vs loss function
